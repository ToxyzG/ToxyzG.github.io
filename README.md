# PTCG-sim

Welcome to the PTCG-sim codebase! We're currently in the process of documenting â€” stay tuned for detailed information about our open-source journey and how you can contribute. 

PTCG-sim is primarily built with JavaScript, using Node.js, Express, and Socket.io as the key frameworks. Socket.io is utilized for two-player functionality.

## Running PTCG-sim Locally

Follow these steps to run PTCG-sim on your local machine:

1. **Install Dependencies:** Execute `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.

2. **Create Sqlite Database:** In the "data" directory, add a file named "db.sqlite". This is needed for storing game states, which is needed for exporting/importing game states as a URL. Note that you need to add this database even if you don't intend working with the export/imports as the server expects the file to exist.

3. **Configure WebSocket Connection:** Navigate to the `global-variables.js` file and replace the WebSocket connection with your own. For instance:
   ```javascript
   const socket = io('http://localhost:4000/');
   ```
   Ensure that the URL is consistent with the one in the server.js file.

4. **Start Local Server:** Use Node.js to start running `server.js` locally. This will load the repository, starting with `front-end.js`. This file initializes various global variables, sets up the DOM, and registers socket event listeners.

Feel free to explore the codebase and play around with the sim! I'm happy to answer any questions and I'm always open to suggestions :)
